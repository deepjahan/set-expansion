  "body": "### About Set Expansion\r\nSome seed terms belonging to a set is given as input. The task is to expand the set by finding more elements belonging to that set. Phrases as seed set is also supported.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\nInput - Python, Perl, Java\r\n\r\nOutput - C++, Javascript, php, Ruby etc.\r\n\r\n### Crawling\r\nThe first phase of the project involves crawling the webpages to get the information to work on. The seed terms are passed to a search API which gives back search results in form of web URLs. These web links are then downloaded, parsed and indexed. We can now use certain techniques to find the required terms\r\n\r\n### Word2Vec\r\nWord2vec is a powerful tool by which each word is represented as a vector in a vector space. The similarity between any two words can be calculated from their corresponding vectors in this vector space. Gensim module was used to build the model of size 1.7 GB by training data from Wikipedia dump of size around 13 GB. \r\n\r\n### Pattern Recognition\r\nThe other technique which can be used is pattern recognition. Here, we find a webpage where seed terms are stored in a pattern (for example, a table or a list). These patterns are recognized and the terms that are found within these patterns and does not belong to our seed set might complete the set. These patterns may also be referred to as wrappers that wraps the elements of a set. This technique does not require a dataset unlike word2vec and hence can find more terms. But, the reliability of the data is something to worry about.\r\n\r\n### Tags\r\n\\#IIITH #IIIT-H #MajorProject #IRE #InformationRetrievalAndExtraction #SetExpansion #Word2Vec #PatternRecognition #Wrappers #Crawling #SearchAPI #Google #Bing #DuckDuckGo #Wiki #Faroo #Twitter #WebHose #StackOverflow #Parsing #Indexing #StopWordsRemoval #Similarity\r\n\r\n### Contributers\r\nSandeep Kasa ( @sandeepkasa ) , Deep Jahan Grewal ( @deepjahan )  and Romil Punetha ( @romilpunetha ) \r\n",
